Some implementations from useful machine learning classes

In this repo, I uploaded some useful machine learning classes code implemented by myself from scratch.
Including:
1. Andrew NG's coursera machine learning class;
2. Andrew NG's openclassroom machine learning class;
3. Andrew NG's Deeplearning.ai class;
4. Earlier version of Stanford UFLDL(CS294A) class.
